<a href="https://pozoseneldesierto.com/" class="border-b-2 border-greeny">Pozos en el desierto</a>
 is a trans-media piece that I developed for a Peruvian Film Studio called Hiperactiva Comunicaciones. This piece  is about a big environmental and social problem in Peru, namely the true cost of the irrational exploitation of the hydric resources of the region by the agricultural industry.
</p>

<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
The website compose a myriad of stories, wish the visitor can choose how and in what order to consume, the stories unfold a that big social and environmental problem of the region, and the work win some prices in several events.
</p>

<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
The project was challenging, interactivity was a core value, and there where lotâ€™s of content, and numerous formats, audio, pictures, diagrams, timelines, documental pieces; all of them where planted in a dessert like setting, with several areas, for the different chapters. This site was achieved with numerous iterations working closely with the Designer and the Client.
