Aristides Inn is a Hotel located in 
Harmuey, Peru. They needed a site
for the Hotel, and to provide a booking experience directly on the site.

<p class="mt-[30px]">
I worked closely with the client and his designer to deliver the piece matching exactly his expectations, just modifying little details here and there to enhance the site performance and usability in different viewports.
</p>

<p class="mt-[30px]">
For the bookings I developed a custom Management System for the
Hotel administrators, allowing to integrate to the site via an API and off course manage all booking related affairs.
