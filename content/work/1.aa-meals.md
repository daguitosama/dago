<a href="https://aa-meals.com" class="border-b-2 border-greeny">AA Meals</a>
 is a healthy food delivery service based on Miami,
they needed a site for the brand, to showcase their service
and get new costumers.
</p>
<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
They also needed a way to allow their costumers sign up from
the website with out needing to call directly.
</p>
<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
I help them to develop their story, designed the site and
the logo, with a clean and fresh visual language. Builded
the web, and a automation that forwards the costumer request
with all relevant details from the site to the managers
phone.

<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
This site was developed with Nuxt 3 (Vue 3), TailwindCSS for styling, and several modules to ship features like Internationalization, the latter was provided in English and Spanish.
</p>

<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
The sing up processing was made by developing a stand alone
Express REST API (Express JS) wish forward the new arrivals to a Telegram Bot with Telegram REST API, that deliver the data to the business managers. 
This API was latter integrated in the site as a staged form. 
To make an easy sing up experience, related fields where composed in 3 different stages.
</p>

<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
The project was finally deployed on a VPS and:
<ul class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl list-disc grid gap-[10px]">
<li>
 • generated with Nuxt and served as static with Nginx,
</li>
<li>
 • using Let's Encrypt certs and automated renewals with ACME.sh,
</li>
<li>
 • the API was defined as a UNIX service with PM2, and also proxy by Nginx, leaving both the site and the API on the same domain,
</li>
<li>
  • additionally was also deployed a self-hosted Plausible Analytics instance to measure traffic.
</li>

</ul>
