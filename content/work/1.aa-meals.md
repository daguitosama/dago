<a href="https://aa-meals.com" class="border-b-2 border-greeny">AA Meals</a>
 is a healthy food delivery service based on Miami,
they needed a site for the brand, to showcase their service
and get new costumers.
</p>
<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
They also needed a way to allow their costumers sign up from
the website with out needing to call directly.
</p>
<p class="mt-[30px] font-medium text-xl">
I help them to develop their story, designed the site and
the logo, with a clean and fresh visual language. Builded
the web, and a automation that forwards the costumer request
with all relevant details from the site to the managers
phone.
