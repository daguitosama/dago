                    I have been building websites since 2020. Some times my
                    clients have a design, some times they donâ€™t even have a
                    Logo, is ok; I like every stage of the work, from planing &
                    design to development & deployment. Im here to make that
                    idea happen!
                </p>
                <p class="mt-[30px]">
                    I see websites as the mere vehicle for the intent or the
                    message that the people behind are actually trying to
                    convey. In that sense, I craft to achieve this primary
                    function, with performance, good practices and accessibility
                    in mind. And off course a unique touch, we deserve simpler
                    and nicer software for our everyday.
