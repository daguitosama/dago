                    I have been building websites since 2020. Some times my
                    clients have a design, some times they donâ€™t even have a
                    Logo, is ok; I like every stage of the work, from planing &
                    design to development & deployment. Im here to make that
                    idea happen!

                    From banking to games, I see the web as a powerful medium of exchange
                    of intent, message, story and experience between people. 
                    In that sense, I craft to achieve the primary functions of the given project, 
                    but with special care for performance, good practices and accessibility. 
                    And off course a unique touch, we deserve simpler
                    and nicer software for our everyday.

                    I also think the web as one of our finest milestones as  a species,
                    not because it brought us to another planet, but because it open up the
                    magic portal to our collective *living* conscience as the Human Kind.
